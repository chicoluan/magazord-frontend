# Magazord Frontend

This document serves as a personal checklist to keep track of important tasks so I don’t forget anything. I’ll be updating it only after a few commits, as it’s easier for me to manage it as notes.

I also export this note from iPadOS as a Markdown file. Keep in mind that the Markdown export only includes the images from the notes as PNGs, which will appear below.

- [x] Initial commit with README default
- [x] Create develop branch
- [x] Push the project into develop branch
- [x] Change develop as default branch in repository
- [x] Create the feature/project-setup branch
- [x] Clean the project, install tailwind and shadcn dependencies
- [x] Pull Request and Merge
- [x] Crete a new branch to start feature/github-api
- [x] Create the api instance with axios and test
- [x] Start creating the routes and update the name of the css file for an idiomatic structure
- [x] Create the type of the user
- [x] Start creating the profile page and the components of them

## MISSING - (DO NOT FORGET):

- [ ] Authenticate the api to check if social accounts is included in the data
- [ ] Refactor page files - maybe tchange their name to page.tsx
- [ ] Replace type of User with Interface
- [ ] Chevron down icon for accordion also blue
- [ ] Add social accounts for users in addional data component
