# Magazord Frontend

This document serves as a personal checklist to keep track of important tasks so I don’t forget anything. I’ll be updating it only after a few commits, as it’s easier for me to manage it as notes.

I also export this note from iPadOS as a Markdown file. Keep in mind that the Markdown export only includes the images from the notes as PNGs, which will appear below.

- [x] Initial commit with README default
- [x] Create develop branch
- [x] Push the project into develop branch
- [x] Change develop as default branch in repository
- [x] Create the feature/project-setup branch
- [x] Clean the project, install tailwind and shadcn dependencies
- [x] Pull Request and Merge
- [x] Crete a new branch to start feature/github-api
- [x] Create the api instance with axios and test
- [x] Start creating the routes and update the name of the css file for an idiomatic structure
- [x] Create the type of the user
- [x] Start creating the profile page and the components of them

## MISSING - (DO NOT FORGET):

- [x] Authenticate the api to check if social accounts is included in the data
- [ ] Add the endpoint '/social_accounts' to fetch the social accounts
- [ ] Refactor page files - maybe tchange their name to page.tsx
- [ ] Replace type of User with Interface
- [ ] Chevron down icon for accordion also blue
- [ ] Add social accounts for users in addional data component

## WORKFLOW ROADMAP

1. TYPE THE USERNAME IN HOME PAGE
2. STORE THE DATA WITH ZUSTAND
3. REDIRECT TO PROFILE PAGE WHERE USE THE ZUSTAND STORE TO FETCH DATA WITH REACT QUERY
